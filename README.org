I use GNU Emacs, and I use *org* file to config emacs, not just documentation. move all files to ~$HOME/.emacs.d~, restart your emacs, packages will be downloaded, installed and configured automatically.

** Attention

- font setting may fail your emacs restart, comment it or install the fonts needed
- libvterm needs to be compiled, if you do not need it, comment the package
- there are ~heavy~ coding related packages, you'd better comment packages you don't need

** major mode for coding

- [X] Rust - eglot
- [X] Golang - eglot
- [X] Clojure - cider
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Elixir
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] \LaTeX
- [ ] Java
